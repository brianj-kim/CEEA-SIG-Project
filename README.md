## Project background (business need/opportunity)
The Engineering and Humanities Special Interest (SIG) Group is a SIG group within the Canadian Engineering Education Association / Association Canadienne de l’éducation en génie (CEEA-ACÉG) national organization that aims to create a space for individuals such as students, teachers, and non-engineering members who are interested in the intersections of engineering and humanities.  To achieve this, regular meetings are held online and in person at CEEA-ACEG conferences. These meetings create an avenue for engagement and valuable knowledge sharing but are not enough for sustainable networking and discussions. 
The goal of this project is to bridge to gulf by creating an online user-friendly platform that enhances visibility, facilitates research sharing, showcases events to the broader community, maps individual networks, and addresses the diversity of technology skills within the membership.


## North Star and Carry Over Customers
-NorthStar (target) customer: Humanities and Engineering SIG members
-Carryover customers: Other SIG members, Students, and engineering educators

## Assumptions
The assumptions made for this project are:
-The current stakeholders will remain the stakeholders for the duration of the project.
-The project will be built using WordPress.
-Free or cheap plugins will be used for the demo website.
-Dummy data will be used in the absence of substantial data.

## Constraints
The constraints for this project are:
-The current knowledge of the technology to be used is lacking and time will be taken to gain proficiency in this platform.
-WordPress is a robust platform that also comes with its limitations that we would need to work around.
-The project must be completed in a short period using the fast feedback cycle which can create some time constraints.
-Free or cheap plugins will be used for this project which limits the resources available to us for this project.
