## Project background (business need/opportunity)
The Canadian Engineering Education Association / Association Canadienne de l’éducation en génie (CEEA-ACÉG), including Engineering and Humanities Speical Interest Group (SIG), holds conferences once a year and meetups (roundtables) monthly or bimonthly, and they don't currently have tools for in-depth, consistent, and sustainable communication channel over their conferences and meetups. They require a platform that facilitates the communication channels, member networking inside and outside of the organization, bilingual support, and an information exchange portal for engineering educators.

## Reason for Project
The purpose of this project is to improve communication and cooperation between academics, instructors, and professionals working in the field of engineering education, especially the Engineering and Humanities SIG within the CEEA-ACÉG. In order to achieve the SIG's objectives, the team is designing an online platform prospecting some features like networking tools, bilingual support, event advertising, information exchange, member-only areas, user friendly interfaces, and building relationships within and outside of the SIG with the ultimate goal of advancing engineering education in contexts related to the Engineering and Humanities.

## North Star and Carry Over Customers
- NorthStar (target) customer: Humanities and Engineering SIG members
- Carryover customers: Other SIG members, Students, and engineering educators

## Important features
Easy to use and user-friendly interface, minimize the administration work (because all the members are busy), and bilingual support, event advertising, information exchange (e.g. research interests), member profile management tool, networking tools for inside and outside of the CEEA-ACÉG.

## Questions, answers, and other relevant information from the first customer/team check-in
- How are membership login credentials gotten?
- Do members create accounts by themselves or is this handled by an identity management system?
